	Chroma Packs allow you to apply new color schemes to your ranch house, vacpack, and ranch tech, allowing you to stand out from all the other ranchers on the Far, Far, Range.

We call this new technology: slime toys.\n\n\
	Slime toys can now be purchased from the shop we have...... just....... installed....... on....... your..... ranch.

m.from.secret_styles = The 7Zee Corporation
m.body.secret_styles = Ms. LeBeau:\n\n\
	What if we told you that the 7Zee Corporation has developed technology called "secret styles" that allows slimes to express themselves, and show off their inner beauty as they saw it?\n\n\
	If you answered that question, please know that we cannot hear you as you are reading starmail on a visual display unit. However, we will proceed as if you are excited:\n\n\
	We're so happy you are excited! Unfortunately the cargo ship containing these secret styles exploded for completely unknown reasons and left them all over the Far, Far Range. Please stay excited!\n\n\

### Exchange Intro mails
m.subj.exchangeintro_thora = Welcome to the Range Exchange!
m.from.exchangeintro_thora = Thora West
m.body.exchangeintro_thora = Hi there, Beatrix! The name's Thora West. I'll keep my introduction short on account that we all got work to do: I'm a long-time rancher here on the Far, Far Range and head of the welcome wagon for your local Range Exchange.\n\n\
  The Range Exchange is a network of ranchers just like yourself who are looking to trade what they got for what they need: slimes, plorts, food- whatever. All you need to do is check out the Range Exchange machine daily and be sure to get your trade completed within 24 hours.\n\n\
  As more ranchers get added to your network, you should receive a hearty hello from them so check your inbox.\n\n\
  Well, enough jawin,' we've both got slimes to wrangle.\n\n\
  Adios, Beatrix.\n\n\
  - Thora

m.subj.exchangeintro_viktor = Salutations, Ms. LeBeau
m.from.exchangeintro_viktor = Viktor Humphries
m.body.exchangeintro_viktor = Allow me to introduce myself. I am Viktor Humphries; professional slime rancher, slime scientist, and amateur musician. My understanding is that Ms West has already informed you of how the Range Exchange works so I will spare you any further education.\n\n\
  Instead, I'll illuminate you on what you can expect from my own requests. As a slime scientist/rancher I have a tremendous interest in the liquiform legion that we share this vast range with, the slimes. My studies often keep me from venturing out on the range daily and when I find myself short of a particular species, I use the Range Exchange to fill that gap. Don't worry though, I will reimburse you handsomely for your efforts.\n\n\
  Good luck in your new venture, Ms LeBeau. I look forward to seeing life breathed once again into the former Twillgers Ranch.\n\n\
  Sincerely,\n\
  Viktor Humphries\n\n\
  P.S. - I once lost my most favorite fiddle while fleeing a feral boom slime. Its value is only sentimental but should you find it, I'd very much love to be able to play it again.

m.subj.exchangeintro_ogden = Hiya Beatrix!
m.from.exchangeintro_ogden = Ogden Ortiz
m.body.exchangeintro_ogden = The name's Ogden Ortiz. I'm a slime rancher much like yourself but I mostly fancy myself as a farmer. I came to the Far, Far Range to grow fruits and veggies the way we used to back on earth: by getting down into the soil and getting your hands dirty.\n\n\
  Did you know that carrots improve your night vision? Yeah, seriously, they do! I don't see why all ranchers aren't just gobbling them down every chance they get. Being lost out on the range at night can be so dangerous...\n\n\
  Well don't let me ramble on ya here. We'll be in touch via the Range Exchange. I tend to only raise slimes that eat fruits and veggies, so expect those kinds of requests from me.\n\n\
  Lookin forward to doing business with ya!\n\n\
  O.O.\n\n\
  P.S. - Ever hear of gilded ginger? It's a mythical veggie that is said to be the favorite food of the equally mythical gold slime. But some say that neither of them actually exist!

m.subj.ogden_invite = Partnership?
m.from.ogden_invite = Ogden Ortiz
m.body.ogden_invite = You seem to be making a name for yourself and I like your style so let me cut right to the chase: I'd like to offer you a job doing a little side work for me. I've got a chunk of land on the outskirts of my property that has access to a place called The Wilds, a land of primitive, feral slimes and dangerous as all get out, but also home to a delicious, rare fruit that I love.\n\n\
  If you're up for a challenge come on down to a little retreat of mine near The Wilds and learn more. I found a derelict teleporter on your network that I've activated on your ranch; it'll take you right to it.\n\n\
  Hope to see you there!\n\n\
  O.O.

m.subj.exchangeintro_mochi = (no subject)
m.from.exchangeintro_mochi = Mochi Miles
m.body.exchangeintro_mochi = Well, well it seems like another wannabe rancher has signed up for a lonely existence on a faraway space rock. Congrats Beatrix!\n\n\
  I'm Mochi Miles. That's 'Miles' as in Tatsuya Miles, the billionaire. I'm here to do important business for my dad but that doesn't mean I won't make all the rest of these backwater types out here look bad in the process. No one conquers the plort market like I do: day in, day out.\n\n\
  My dad gives me the inside track so look forward to my requesting plorts that I know will make me huge profits later on.\n\n\
  So I wish you the best of luck, Beatrix. Maybe you'll even reach second place! And at the very least you can tell your friends that you helped out the great Mochi Miles in her conquest of the Far, Far Range!\n\n\
  Later, tater.\n\n\
  Mochi Miles, Top Rancher

m.subj.mochi_invite = (no subject)
m.from.mochi_invite = Mochi Miles
m.body.mochi_invite = The other ranchers won't shut up about you and it's starting to get annoying. So let's see what all the fuss is about.\n\n\
  I'd like to talk business with you. So I went ahead and activated a spare teleporter in that horrible cave you call a ranch expansion. The teleporter will take you to my estate (I have others too) where we can work out the details.\n\n\
  Don't keep me waiting.\n\n\
  See ya there, square.\n\n\
  Mochi Miles, Top Rancher

m.subj.exchangeintro_bob = helloooo
m.from.exchangeintro_bob = BOb
m.body.exchangeintro_bob = Hello,,\n\
  hellohellooo......chickeNs.\n\
  helloCHickens.\n\
  chICKEN.\n\n\
  hello,\n\
  BOb\n\n\
  PSs.-- chickKn

m.subj.viktor_invite = Assistance required
m.from.viktor_invite = Viktor Humphries
m.body.viktor_invite = Ms LeBeau, I have heard of your accomplishments here on the Far, Far Range. You seem to be very capable, quick-thinking, and able to adapt to new conditions; exactly the kind of person I need for my latest project.\n\n\
  Should you find this proposition agreeable, I have activated a teleporter in your Lab to my undersea Workshop. I hope to see you soon.\n\n\
  Sincerely,\n\
  Viktor Humphries\n\n\
  P.S. - Should you accept this offer I propose we refer to each other in a casual manner going forward. A reduction in formality will expedite every future interaction that relies on dialogue. In short, may I please refer to you as Beatrix?

### Personal mails
m.subj.casey_1 = Rise and shine!
m.from.casey_1 = Casey
m.body.casey_1 = Hi Bea,\n\n\
    What's it like to sleep for a whole year? Did you dream? I can't imagine what that's like. 7Zee puts you in a pod and and then lights out for all that time... wow.\n\n\
	What's the Far, Far Range like? Have you started exploring? Is the air as clear as they say? I bet it's really beautiful.\n\n\
	I'm probably asking too many questions. I bet you have a lot of work to do on that ranch. I still can't believe it's yours now.\n\n\
	I guess I better leave you to it and just keep it short: good luck, Bea. If anyone can make it out there, it's you.\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_2 = My pet cactus
m.from.casey_2 = Casey
m.body.casey_2 = Hi Bea,\n\n\
    I bought a cactus from you, sort of. When I came back home it was one of the only things left in your shop. Was a lonely little guy so I decided to adopt it.\n\n\
    You know I kill every plant I touch, but I promise you this one will last. I mean, if I can't keep a cactus alive then clearly something is really wrong!\n\n\
    When I look at it I think of you out there on the range, doing your thing. Hope you're ok.\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_3 = Re: The big storm
m.from.casey_3 = Casey
m.body.casey_3 = I got your mail: of course I remember that day. I feel like that was when you and I really connected. It was raining so hard that the streets were flooding and we took shelter in that cafe. It was like a scene from a movie only we both looked like wet animals. And the guy running the shop was a real tyrant. The only way we could stay inside was by ordering one coffee after another.\n\n\
    I felt like we learned more about each other that day than ever. Maybe it was the coffee because we were both talking really, really fast. I told you about my dreams; making music and all that. At least that's how I remember it.\n\n\
	Walking home, when the rain came back you got closer to me and my heart was racing. But I couldn't blame that on the coffee.\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_4 = The death hike
m.from.casey_4 = Casey
m.body.casey_4 = Hi Bea,\n\n\
    Do you remember when you took me hiking? I still didn't know how serious you were about the whole outdoors thing then and your idea of a hike just about killed me! I showed up in normal clothes and shoes and you were decked out and had a pack and gear, it was a nightmare for me, haha.\n\n\
	I think it was around the five mile mark, when I was drenched in sweat and ready to collapse that I realized our ideas of fun were two very different things. Also you weren't even out of breath then and I still totally hate you for that :)\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_5 = Re: the... VAN
m.from.casey_5 = Casey
m.body.casey_5 = Haha, it wasn't THAT bad. You just don't have the fortitude to make it as an artist, I guess. Beatrix LeBeau can climb a mountain before breakfast but can't spend a few days in a *ahem* modestly accommodated, breaks-down-only-half-the-time, VINTAGE touring van. You were so miserable. I still laugh about it.\n\n\
    But I really did appreciate it for those few days. It was great to have you in the crowd.\n\n\
	That van still runs by the way.\n\n\
	- Casey\n\n\
	P.S. That was a lie. The van literally caught on fire while we were driving it. It died like a viking.

m.subj.casey_6 = New Year's Eve
m.from.casey_6 = Casey
m.body.casey_6 = Hi Bea,\n\n\
    Do you remember New Year's Eve when we were looking for that party?\n\n\
	While we were wandering around the city, lost, I got my bearings and didn't tell you because I knew we were close to that coffee shop run by the tyrant. And since it was starting to rain I thought it would be really romantic to stumble across the place again. I guess I finally found the courage.\n\n\
	But the coffee shop went out of business and it was a taco place now. So, we ate tacos in the rain and it was just the best thing.\n\n\
	We were on the roof of your old apartment hoping to see the fireworks. I was going to tell you something then but that's when you told me about Africa. It sounded like an amazing trip. I was really happy you were doing what you loved to do.\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_7 = Re: Africa
m.from.casey_7 = Casey
m.body.casey_7 = Thanks, Bea. I never knew you felt that way. I picture you out there on a safari, avoiding the clutches of lions on the savanna, riding elephants across raging rivers, and then, as you sit under the stars at night, your weathered hand opens up a locket and there's a picture of me inside. And then your loyal chimpanzee companion gives you a somber, knowing look.\n\n\
    Is that accurate? haha\n\n\
	Well, for what it's worth I missed you too when I was in LA. Uuugh, that bar was just awful, but at least I got some stage time.\n\n\
	- Casey\n\n\
	P.S. The chimp's name was Colonel Bananas.

m.subj.casey_8 = Coming home
m.from.casey_8 = Casey
m.body.casey_8 = Hi Bea,\n\n\
    The year we both came home, do you think it ever could have worked? I mean, being with you again every day instead of the long distance thing, that was great. I remember feeling really happy, but something was missing. We both knew that we were giving something up for it all.\n\n\
	I think about it all the time. That if we had been less honest about it all how you might still be running that little garden shop and I'd still be trying to write music out of a basement.\n\n\
	It doesn't matter. I should have told you then what I never did. I should have said it a hundred times.\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_9 = Re: London
m.from.casey_9 = Casey
m.body.casey_9 = I know, it was the right thing to do. I appreciate you letting me know, but it never felt the same as having you close by. London was an opportunity I couldn't pass up, an opportunity to tour and do what I love.\n\n\
    But I still missed you like crazy. And when you told me about going to the Far, Far Range it made me miss you even more, even before you were gone.\n\n\
	I guess that's just us: what we really want just so happens to be in different parts of the known universe. I mean, there's long distance and then there's being so far away that time itself might actually function differently. Why aren't there more songs about that, huh?\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_10 = Re: Life is different now
m.from.casey_10 = Casey
m.body.casey_10 = I had a year to think about things while you slept on your way across the stars. I think it almost scared me when things got easier, and when I finally realized that what we each have now is what we wanted all along. Because if you're still the girl that I know, you're happy out there on the very farthest frontier.\n\n\
    And I hope the happiness you feel now lasts forever. I hope that the sunsets over there are as gorgeous as they are over here and that if you search far enough on a rainy day some rancher out there has a taco stand you can visit. I realize that last one probably isn't likely to happen but it sure would be romantic, right?\n\n\
	I'm glad to have shared a part of me with you, Beatrix LeBeau. And I'm happy to know that maybe one of those stars I see up there in the sky is you.\n\n\
	- Casey

m.subj.casey_11 = Another tour
m.from.casey_11 = Casey
m.body.casey_11 = Hi Bea,\n\n\
    There's another tour coming up and I have a feeling that this will be the one.\n\n\
    So here I am, packing my bags and thinking of you. Maybe this is how it felt when you were leaving for your big adventure. Lots of excitement, lots of butterflies.\n\n\
    And even though I know you're so far away, I keep thinking that maybe I'll catch you somewhere out there in the crowd.\n\n\
    If that ever happens, I promise I'll sing a song for you. It wouldn't be the first time.\n\n\
    - Casey

m.subj.hobson_1 = Hello there!
m.from.hobson_1 = Hobson Twillgers
m.body.hobson_1 = Hello Beatrix!\n\n\
    I just wanted to say thanks for taking care of the ol' ranch. I know I left it in a bit of a sorry state and from what I hear, it's lookin mighty fine these days. Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy knowing that it's in such good hands.\n\n\
    As a little thank you, I've activated three secret vaults that I built years ago to stash a small fortune of mine. I had always planned on using it as walking around money in the great beyond, but I ain't needing for that no more.\n\n\
    But you know me, I like a good adventure. I'm not telling where the vaults are located. Go explore!\n\n\
    - H

###### Hobson Journals
m.journal.jo_ranch_lab = I built this lab after meeting a slime scientist and learning about the wonders of plort technology. I figured it would be fun to tinker with on rainy days.\n\n\
I only nearly blew myself up three times, which is pretty good given my tendency for that sort of thing in my other hobbies. But it soon became a reminder that I have a thirst for adventure, and being cooped up in a barn all day wasn't ever going to satisfy that thirst.\n\n\
Soon, I began to set my sights for horizons beyond this ranch. And once I got to thinking on it, further still.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_ranch_grotto = Before I left the ranch I found myself sleeping most nights in this here grotto. I'd fill it full of phosphor slimes and watch them dance in the dark. Drifting off, I'd pretend I was drifting in a sea of stars, across the limitless black of space.\n\n\
It's funny how when you dream, you sure become a sucker for the impossible. Every time I woke to find myself back in the grotto I'd feel a little sadness. But then it was back to work. There was always something that needed doing.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_ranch_overgrowth = I built this area myself by spreading soil from the Moss Blanket all over the ground, just to see what would happen. I was hoping it would attract a hunter slime or two, but no such luck. Maybe I need to get some of them big mushrooms to grow here instead? They sure seem to like hanging out around those things.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_ranch_docks = A view of the sea really reminds you of our greater purpose, Beatrix. The sea was the first great unknown, and then space, and then whatever is beyond all that. That need to see what's around the next corner is in my bones, and since you're out here, I reckon it's in yours too.\n\n\
Though, I suppose you could also be out here because you like the fresh air. Or you prefer the untamed beauty of this land. Or maybe it's because you're looking to leave something far behind ya. Sure is the way to do it; doesn't get much further than this.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_reef_intro = Hello Beatrix!\n\n\
The name's Hobson Twillgers: rancher, explorer, and the former owner of this here ranch you now call your own. Pleased to make your acquaintance!\n\n\
I was a rancher for more years than I can remember and felt there was one last adventure left in me so I've set off to find just that. But before I go I'm taking one last tour around this here land I love. So keep your peepers peeled for notes like these, if you want to hear what an old coot has to say every now and again.\n\n\
Be talking to ya!\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_reef_circles = I used to come to this beach to think. I'd sit and stare at that those distant rings and ruminate on who created them and for what purpose.\n\n\
But most of all, I'd sit here and think of her.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_reef_bigtree = I had a great, big tree like this here one along the edge of my property back on Earth. It had been there before anyone could remember. It survived all kinds of change around it and then one day I began to notice it was dying.\n\n\
Wasn't anything unnatural, was just its time I suppose. And then I realized that if I didn't do something, I'd end up like that tree: I'd spend my whole life in the same place.\n\n\
I wasn't going to let that happen. So I bought a ticket for the Far, Far Range the very next day.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_reef_boot = I once lost a boot off this here cliff.\n\n\
Now, I never said that these journals would be full of important information. And to be fair, it was a darn good boot.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_reef_curious = If you're reading this, you must be a naturally curious person who doesn't mind a little risk now and again.\n\n\
I think if we ever met, we'd get along just fine.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_reef_ferals = This entire cave system was sealed off from a cave-in when I first discovered it. Maybe that's why the fellas up ahead are so grumpy: haven't had a bite in a long time.\n\n\
In any case, don't let that long-awaited bite come from your own rump! Bring some food to calm them down.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_moss_exit = The first time I went exploring the Moss Blanket I got stuck here so I constructed a way out. It's just up yonder.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_moss_forest = The Moss Blanket may seem like an ancient jungle of sorts, but the fact is that much of what you see here wasn't even around when I first began exploring this land. At this rate, I reckon that it won't be long before this greenery completely overtakes the Far, Far Range!\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_moss_love = Have you ever been in love, Beatrix? Makes you feel all achy inside, like a day after your soul's been to the gym. That's the best way I can describe it, anyway.\n\n\
It also realigns your thinking to something you swear is downright alien. All those things you thought really mattered suddenly don't. Changes you entirely!\n\n\
Can't recommend it enough.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_moss_danger = I highly advise you have a jetpack and a few upgrades before tackling what's ahead. The land is all broken and twisted and there's plenty of feral slimes about who you won't see coming before they blast you right into the sea.\n\n\
Keep those peepers peeled!\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_quarry_springs = I used to come here when I needed a good soak. It's a great way to clear your head.\n\n\
Sometimes I'd catch a puddle slime blushing and I could never tell if it was because I was in my bathing suit or not.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_quarry_crystals = I once came here to collect crystals for a little project of mine. Was trapped here for nearly two days when those curious crystal slimes came rolling my way and started firing off those dangerous shards. I thought I was gonna kick the bucket!\n\n\
The crystals were for a wind chime. I bet Thora still has it hanging from her porch.\n\n\
Worth it.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_quarry_stars = It was here that I knew I had to leave once again. I had spent the entire day exploring, trying to find my way to this island. And though I spent the rest of the night walking along the shore in the soft glow of these fireflowers, I caught myself looking up again and again.\n\n\
Once more, I was looking to the stars.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_quarry_alone = I was always happiest when I was by my lonesome. Places like this old quarry really suited me: nice and quiet and mostly empty. So I figured that life on the Far, Far Range would suit me just as well.\n\n\
And well wouldn't you just know it? I come all this way and the first person I see... well, she changed how I saw things I guess. Quiet wasn't good anymore. I liked her laugh.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_ruins_lemons = The ghostly phase lemon trees that you may have seen were a real head scratcher to me for the longest time. I kept dreaming about an ice-cold glass of lemonade on the long summer days I spent exploring these ruins. Delicious stuff!\n\n\
But here's the trick: if you want those lemons, you've got to be willing to part with a fruit of your own. Give it a shot.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_ruins_intro = Fascinating aren't they? Who do you think constructed these ancient ruins, and for what purpose? I'd visit this place and ponder that question often. Only one thing is for certain: these folks liked slimes!\n\n\
Eventually I came to realize what this place was for and how to utilize it.\n\n\
Will you do the same?\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_ruins_doors = These strange, glass doors are a good reminder that you can't always have both. Hit that switch over there all you like and both doors will never be open.\n\n\
Sometimes you gotta choose one path or another and there's no way around it. But you know what? Either path you choose is gonna make you hurt some for want of walking the other.\n\n\
Life is filled with doors like these.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_ruins_sanctum = The ruins used to be some kind of warp station, used by whoever created it to connect to one of the most distant corners of the Far, Far Range. Be careful, Beatrix: once you cross over you'll be in truly untamed country. Though beautiful, the other side can be an unforgiving place.\n\n\

m.journal.jo_desert_firestorm = The Glass Desert is a fascinating place but you need to be on guard: at any moment a dangerous solar anomaly can occur that will cause all heck to break loose for a spell.\n\n\
You'll know it when you see it, and when you do, head for cover or risk burning your tuchus!\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_desert_fountain = The desert is a harsh place for sure, but there are little pockets like this where life is waiting to flow back into the soil, and reach toward the clouds.\n\n\
Of course, it might happen a little faster if you give it a helping hand. Use that noggin, Beatrix!\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_desert_glass = Must have been one heck of a scorcher that caused these glass formations. They always looked like flames to me, like a great firestorm covered this land before being frozen in time.\n\n\
Then again, maybe these are flames burning away but at a pace we can't even perceive. Perhaps this desert has two different times overlapping one another and here we are stuck in the middle of it.\n\n\
Wouldn't that just be wild?\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_desert_overlook = Quite a sight to gaze upon the sand sea out there, no? I've scoured every corner of the desert and everywhere I look, that sand sea stretches to the horizon. Makes you wonder just where the heck on the Far, Far Range you are when the Slime Sea is nowhere to be found!\n\n\

m.journal.jo_desert_end01 = Two doors, Beatrix. Life is filled with moments where there's two doors and you can only choose one.\n\n\
I came to the Far, Far Range because a search for the unknown is in my bones. And in time, even a thousand light years away from Earth wasn't enough. So I searched for secrets within the Ancient Ruins that led me here.\n\n\
This place was my ticket to go even further.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_desert_end02 = The ruins are actually great engines that allow for travel through space and maybe even time! After years of study, I knew how to activate them and I alone would be the first to cross over into the true beyond. It was the ultimate adventure.\n\n\
But then there's that other door: I met Thora and fell in love. What are the chances of that?\n\n\
She had a piece of my heart, and the universe had the other.\n\n\
Two doors, Beatrix.\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_desert_end03 = I chose my door.\n\n\
I went back to the ranch and promptly sold it. I packed my things, and took a tour of this beautiful land one last time, leaving these little notes for you. It was time I said goodbye to the life I had.\n\n\
My hands and feet tingled as I approached this monolithic warp terminal. What lay ahead of me was an adventure unlike anything I had ever known in my life.\n\n\
I stepped on to the platform, my heart racing...\n\n\
- H

m.journal.jo_desert_end04 = ...but I didn't go.\n\n\
I had packed for a new adventure, but it wasn't going to be beyond space and time. So I said a little goodbye to what could have been and headed to Thora's ranch. I'm looking forward to hearing the sound of those wind chimes.\n\n\
I've never been in love before. Never known anything like it. It's time I got to knowing what all the fuss is about.\n\n\
So good luck to ya, Beatrix. Always remember to use your head, but let your heart do the thinkin' every now and again. It might surprise ya.\n\n\
